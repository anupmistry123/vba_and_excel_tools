VBA And Excel Tools Library
########################################
- This is a collection of some of the Excel and VBA tools I created to help speed up tasks.
- The code is as standardised and readable as possible.
- Some tools use class modules, others do not if it was neccesary that they were created very quickly , or I hadn't yet become familiar with the concept of class modules.
- Time prevailing, I tried to update the code of tools to make it more readable and easier to edit by other users.
